        "Instead of using `predict(weights, instance)`, we use `sigmoid(in_value)` because the perceptron training relies on gradient-based updates. The sigmoid function provides us with a differentiable activation function that allows the perceptron to perform weight updates based on gradient descent. The `predict` function outputs are binary (0 or 1), which cannot be employed in gradient-based optimization since they do not provide a smooth function on which to calculate gradients. So Using `sigmoid(in_value)` will ensure that small weight updates are made in the correct direction, leading to effective learning.\n",

For instance, 85.7% accuracy was achieved when 75% of the training set was used to train (tr = 20, epochs = 100, lr = 0.005), and therefore the use of 100% of the dataset is not always required for optimal performance.

Smaller learning rate results in smaller weight changes, which could result in slow convergence or even underfitting if the model is not able to learn well within the given number of epochs.\n",
